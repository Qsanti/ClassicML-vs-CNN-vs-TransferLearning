# Classic ML vs CNN vs Transfer Learning
**Notebook&amp;Report** of a **face recognition classification task** comparing three ways of achieving it:
* A *classic machine learning classificator*
* A *convolitional neural network* builted from scratch 
* A *transfer learning* aproach replacing *dense layers* of a pre-trained CNN

Done as one of the assignments to "Fundamentals of Machine Learning" subject.
